# Foundry PLANT (**PLA**yer **N**eeds **T**racker)

A module for Foundry VTT to track your players needs.

Needs can be whatever you feel like:
- Frequent enough chance to do something
- Enough interactions in a session
- Roleplaying
- Strategy
- Combat
- Magic and wonder
- Story
- Just plain rolling dice
